## üìÅ Project Overview

The Nuclear application is a modern web application built with Next.js 14, featuring:

- **Type-safe database operations** with Prisma abstractions
- **Interactive learning components** (quizzes, fill-in-the-blanks)
- **Content management system** with hierarchical organization
- **Gamification features** with points tracking
- **Modern UI** with Tailwind CSS and Nyxb UI

## üîß Development Philosophy

### Type Safety First
All database operations use Prisma-generated types, ensuring compile-time safety and excellent IDE support.

### Abstraction Layer
Custom Prisma abstractions provide consistent, reusable database operations with built-in error handling.

### Modern Development
- Hot reloading for fast development
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modern JavaScript features
- Component-based architecture

### Performance Focused
- Optimized database queries
- Efficient React components
- Proper indexing and caching strategies
